# Reporting-tasks-project
## Using this technologies:
* Web api
* My sql
* PHP
* WinForms
* Angular
## install the app:
  1. Run the `ReportingTasksProject` project.(the web api one)  This is the server.

  2.  Run the `php` server by 
        ```sh 
        shift+f6
        ```
        on the index.php page

  3. Run `ng serve` for a dev server, if you want to run the angular project. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
      shoose which server you want to: the web api or the php one. 
      you can choose it in the `global` page
  4. Run the winform project  
  5. [Run the `mySql` code](https://github.com/tzviaEdelstein1/Reporting-tasks-project/blob/master/sqlScript.md) 

   * important thing in order to `send email` ip php platporm you have to change afew thing in the xampp files 
     in "C:\xampp\php\php.ini" find [mail function] and change 
     ```sh
       SMTP=smtp.gmail.com
       smtp_port=587
       sendmail_from = my-gmail-id@gmail.com
       sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"
       ```
       now Open C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.ini. Replace all the existing code in sendmail.ini with following code
       ```sh
       [sendmail]   
       smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
       smtp_port=587
       error_logfile=error.log
       debug_logfile=debug.log
       auth_username=my-gmail-id@gmail.com
       auth_password=my-gmail-password
       force_sender=my-gmail-id@gmail.com
       ```
       PS: don't forgot to replace my-gmail-id and my-gmail-password in above code.
       Also remember to restart the server using the XAMMP control panel so the changes take effect.
